# WebComponent Framework
This is an early version of a WebComponent framework for easy creation of browser-based user interfaces.

This project was inspired from the experience gained during various experiments using this technology. The user interface of the AwesomeWaveSplineMachine, for example. Which I am planning to replace by a version that uses this library, sometime in the future.

The objective is the following. No transpiling. No dependencies. Self explanatory object oriented datastructure that works on the client and on the server. Easy serialization and deserialization. Straight forward use of WebComponents. Dynamic and efficent user interface updates. Flexible two way binding. Dynamic list support. Lazy stylesheet and template loading. Atomic failsafe dom rendering. Memory leak avoidance.

Even though all these features are currently implemented in some way, I do not recommend using this framework in your projects. I am planning far-reaching changes. Nothing is stable.
